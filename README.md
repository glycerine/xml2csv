xml2csv
-------

XML is a pain, and the existing Go libraries for dealing with it are a sad lot.

Here we convert .xml to .csv (comma separated values) for sane further processing.

This code will parse an XML file on stdin, and write csv to stdout. No schema required.

It was written for a specific need, and is not polished at all. Feel free
to fork and adapt it to your own needs. I'll probably not do further work on it, but
maybe it can be starting point for something of yours.
